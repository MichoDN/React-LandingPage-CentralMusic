# MichoDN-CentralMusic-LandingPage
Static Landing page developed in react.

This project is a landing page that I designed and developed using ReactJS. 
I created this page to showcase my skills in web application development using this technology.

It's important to note that the page design is not my own, but was created by stevekappel. 
If you're interested in learning more about their work, I invite you to visit his figma profile https://www.figma.com/@stevekappel.
